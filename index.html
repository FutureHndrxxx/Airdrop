    <h2>Leancoin Airdrop</h2>
    	<h3>Get some free <a href="https://leanco.in" target="_blank">Leancoin tokens</a> on the Polygon Network!</h3>
    <p>
    	Please make sure you are using the Polygon mainnet before you hit the button below!
    	<br><br>
    	Once you do, you will simply accept two transactions: one free signature to verify you own the address the 100 SIPLEAN tokens are to be airdropped to, and another which will send the transaction to the smart contract in order to dispense the free tokens to you!
